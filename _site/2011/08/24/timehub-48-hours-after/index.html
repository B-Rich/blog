  <article class="post-content">
    <p>As you may know, we created <strong><a href="http://timehub.net">TimeHub</a></strong> in under 48
hours for the Rally on Rails contest. I wanted to write this post because it&#39;s
been 48 hours since the <strong>public votes were opened</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>First of all, I would like to thank EVERYONE that has talked about Timehub. It&#39;s been really nice to see all the comments and feedback. It&#39;s been even better to see so many votes so fast! We honestly didn&#39;t expected this support and having over 3950 points in under 48 hours! THANK YOU!</strong></p>

<p>it&#39;s important to note that votes are still open (until August 26th), and if
you haven&#39;t vote for us, you should! <a href="http://ranking.timehub.net/how-to-%0Avote">Click here to get the instructions and a
free heavenly holly ice-cream at the end</a> (spanish version <a href="http://ranking.timehub.net/como-votar">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="the-judges">The Judges</h2>

<p>It&#39;s an honor to say that we won the judges votes. We got 88 points and got
the first place. Really really, scary-close was team 53 (moove it) with 86
points and in third place, it was team 43 (ochoigualiguald) with 82 points!</p>

<p>We were the only ones with 5/5 in innovation which really made us happy!</p>

<p><strong>I would like to thank the judges, sponsors and the Rally on Rails team to make this contest possible.</strong></p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the public votes.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-started">How we started</h2>

<p>We started tweeting A LOT when we found out the votes were opened. *<em>Sorry for
all the spam my dear followers. It won&#39;t last long. I promise. *</em>We really
needed the first impulse to make people notice us.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110824-rkkxubg89pdq5a9ctj1xm1i611.jpg" alt="My spam"></p>

<p>We tweeted friends, coworkers, students, professors, some ruby-heroes, some
&quot;public&quot; tweets. Everything. We have a Skype conversation with what we tweeted
and prepared other tweets too. <strong>We&#39;ve been thinking them for a while (is not
coincidence that our about page is actually a &quot;showing our love&quot; page (<a href="http://timehub.net/love"><a href="http://timehub.net/love">http:
//timehub.net/love</a></a>)</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-got">What we got</h2>

<p>We really did not expect what came next. A lot of people started talking about
<strong>Timehub</strong>. **I had never felt like a rockstar before, but today was my day!
**We got a lot of nice feedback. Ryan Bates from
<a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/rbates/status/106034170756739072">responded</a> (it was
AWESOME having him reply our tweet!). <a href="https://github.com/defunkt">Chris
Wanstrath</a> (defunkt - Githubs CEO) <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/defunkt/status/106061419325308928">retweeted
this</a>. Heck, we even
got a <a href="https://twitter.com/jcleblanc/status/105910807119933440">O&#39;Reilly writer to tweet about
it</a>! The coolest
thing about that is that we really didn&#39;t ask them to do that (we asked Ryan,
but the writer was just on his own will!) That was beautiful! Matthias Wiemann
tweeted and got 33 RTs!</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0M1Z0f1a1b0X1M3m1d2q/Screen%20Shot%202011-08-2%0A4%20at%201.49.28%20AM.png" alt="33 RTS!"></p>

<p>We were on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> main page for a while.
In fact, that&#39;s were we got the most feedback and visits from (more on that
later, with some graphs).</p>

<p>Of course, not everything was rainbows and butterflies. We also got some &quot;bad&quot;
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ifesdjeen/status/105970902675636224">comments</a> and
feedback (<strong>which we honestly really appreciate</strong>), but that was expected. We
admit, and have always admitted that the commit DLS needs to be MUCH better.
We&#39;ll considering git notes and creating a gem to make it easier and keeping
commits as clean as possible. But we had 48  hours so for now, that&#39;s the best
we could do.</p>

<h2 id="cheating">Cheating</h2>

<p>We were doing great (we still are btw) until some guys started cheating! I
thought, <strong>&quot;OMG we&#39;re doing SO GREAT that they have to cheat!&quot;</strong> We created a
<a href="http://ranking.timehub.net/cheating">report</a> about it, and send it to the
judges. We decided to remove <a href="http://ranking.timehub.net/">our global ranking
page</a> while this was fixed. Judges fixed it right
away and we were back in the game!</p>

<p>This really made us sad. We worked really hard on the app and were working
(spamming) a lot to keep people talking about it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-data">Conclusion and Data</h2>

<p>So, according to Google Analytics, we&#39;ve got <strong>7,420 visits **and</strong> 10,658
pageviews. **This is amazing for 2 days. Honestly, didn&#39;t expect it!</p>

<h2 id="country/territory-of-visits">Country/Territory of visits</h2>

<p>Probably what shocked me the most is that we&#39;re now getting more visits from
the U.S than from Colombia. This is shocking because I expected my friends to
visit the site, but I don&#39;t have more friends in the U.S than here! Here&#39;s the
Top Five (out of <strong>104</strong> countries):</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1c3A0V1i1y1T0B3I1v22/Screen%20Shot%202011-08%0A-24%20at%202.18.13%20AM.png" alt="Top Five!"></p>

<p>Honestly, 2000+ visits agains 800+? That&#39;s a HUGE difference! Here&#39;s the whole
map</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3a392z3f0r1I2W3j2i2K/Screen%20Shot%202011-08-24%20at%%0A202.20.59%20AM.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="traffic-sources">Traffic Sources</h2>

<p>The traffic sources also amazed me. We&#39;ve had more referred visits than direct
traffic, but that was not really shocking (who&#39;s gonna write timehub.net
anyway?)</p>

<p>What really shocked me is that even though we tweeted A LOT, got a lot of RTs
and a lot of people tweeted, it was half of the visits we got from Hacker
News!</p>

<p>With <strong>2,799 visits *<em>(more than direct traffic visits! - 2,424) Hacker News
was the #1 referrer and traffic source for us. Twitter (t.co + twitter.com)
was the second referrer but with *</em>851 visits (713 from t.co and 130 from
twitter.com)</strong>! That means that we got <strong>over 1900 visits from HN compared to
twitter</strong>! We were only a few minutes in the main page! I can&#39;t imagine the
traffic a site will get for being there a whole morning! Here&#39;s the top 10
(plus one) traffic sources:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3l1r101q022e330f370z/Screen%20Shot%202%0A011-08-24%20at%202.29.10%20AM.png" alt="Traffic Sources"></p>

<p>I added the #11 to show that the traffic <strong>2,799 visits are only from the .com
domain. We&#39;re getting traffic for .org/.net, ihackernews.com and others like
that!</strong></p>

<p><strong>I will be posting more and more details and info about how it goes. If you havent, please vote for us!</strong></p>

<p><strong>THANKS A LOT,</strong></p>
