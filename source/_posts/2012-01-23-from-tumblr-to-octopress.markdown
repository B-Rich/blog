I wrote an article yesterday about URL design and I spent about an hour fighting with [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) to format my `code inside a pre (or code) tag`. I knew I was done with them. Today, I'm giving [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) a try. I honestly wanted to try [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) but I was really lazy to code my HTML. So, for now, I'm welcoming Octopress.

I really love the fact that I can write in Markdown, it's really powerful yet simple that makes me focus on writing and not formatting. I know I can use mdown in Tumblr but I don't have Textmate there, so this is a big +1 for Jekyll/Octopress.
