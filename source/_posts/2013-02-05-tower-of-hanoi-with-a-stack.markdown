I've recently subscribed to [Coding for Interviews](http://codingforinterviews.com/)
and received my first email today. The content is great and you should join. 
Even if you're not looking for a job, it's a short read with nice topics to

but today's challenge was to solve the [Tower of Hanoi][1] problem without
recursion.

Here's my solution:

There's another iterative solution but I haven't implemented it. So, if you did
or have some other way to solve this, I'd love to know on
