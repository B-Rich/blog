I just wanted to "personally" say thanks to everyone who voted for my entry on
the [Rally on Rails](http://rallyonrails.com) (Latinamerican Rails Rumble).

[Timehub](http://timehub.net) won! And this couldn't be possible without the
people who voted.

I would like to thank the Rally on Rails team & judges. They made an excellent
job and even though there are somethings to improve (like the voting rules),
**I think that the contest was great!**

We had already posted a "[thank you
note](http://blog.timehub.net/post/9404894926/from-medellin-with-love)", in
the [Timehub](http://timehub.net) blog, but I really wanted to write one
myself.

I was pretty spammer during these last 3 days! That will stop now!

**Thanks again!** Hope to see you in [Timehub](http://timehub.net) v2!
