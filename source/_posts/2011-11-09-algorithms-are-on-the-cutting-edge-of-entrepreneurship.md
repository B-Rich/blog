> Algorithms are on the cutting edge of entrepreneurship. If you're talking
about just re-implementing stuff that people did ten years ago, performance
isn't that important at some level. But, if you're talking about doing stuff
that nobody has done before, one of the reasons often that they haven't done
it is because it's too time-consuming.
