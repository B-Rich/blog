  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seriously, it&#39;s <strong>your</strong> fault that Github exposed your keys. If you want to
add everything to your repo (not that this is a good idea though), at least
make it private.</p>

<p>If you want to have <strong>per-environment variables, use the environment variables</strong>.
<em>But my development env would be full of crap!</em> some of you may cry&#8230; well,
there&#39;s a simple solution for that. Use <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv">Dotenv</a>.</p>

<p>With <em>Dotenv</em> you only need to add a <code>.env</code> file to your application root directory
and you&#39;re done. Here&#39;s a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh"><span class="c"># .env</span>
<span class="nv">S3_BUCKET</span><span class="o">=</span>some_development_bucket
<span class="nv">S3_SECRET</span><span class="o">=</span>a_secret_key
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then in your code, simply use <code>ENV[]</code> and be happy (and safe, but mostly happy)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="c1"># some config file</span>
<span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fog_directory</span>  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">ENV</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;S3_BUCKET&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And just like that, you can setup your server&#39;s config environments and not
worry about <em>supposed-to-be-private</em> public information.</p>

<p>One really cool thing about this is that this variables will only be loaded
in that specific application. It won&#39;t change <strong>your</strong> environment. So when
you stop the servers, your environment won&#39;t have the <code>.env</code> variables.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="http://opensoul.org/blog/archives/2012/07/24/dotenv/">Dotenv here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since <a href="http://gembundler.com/" title="Bundler">bundler</a> came out, managing dependencies
on ruby applications has been amazing. Combined with <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2998-setting-up-a-new-machine-for-ruby-development" title="37 Signals bootstrap script">some</a> <a href="http://zachholman.com/talk/unsucking-your-teams-development-environment/" title="Zach Holman&#39;s talk on development environment">bootstrap</a> <a href="http://ngauthier.com/2012/08/one-click-development.html" title="One click development">script</a>,
it&#39;s really easy to download some source code, install, and run an application.</p>

<p>There is still some room for improvement though. I&#39;ve always supported the use
of <a href="http://semver.org/" title="SemVer: Semantic Versioning">SemVer</a> and pessimistic locking (the <code>~&gt;</code>). This will allow you to
update applications without pain. And, with all this rails vulnerabilities,
you need just that.</p>

<p>But, since people don&#39;t always have the versions on their <code>Gemfile</code>, <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/12/18/rails-4-and-your-gemfile.html" title="Rails 4 and your Gemfile">this can get
a little messy</a>. So, I&#39;ve created a simple gem to help you with that.</p>

<h3 id="toc_73">Welcome version_gemfile</h3>

<ul>
<li>1. Simply install it: <code>$ gem install version_gemfile</code></li>
<li>2. Go to your rails application: <code>$ cd ~/my/ruby/application</code></li>
<li>3. And add the versions to your <em>Gemfile</em>: <code>$ version_gemfile</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_74">How does it work?</h2>

<p>This gem will go through each line in your <code>Gemfile</code> looking for dependencies
that have no versions. Then, will look into your <code>Gemfile.lock</code> for the version
you are currently using and add a pessimistic lock on that version.</p>

<p>The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/nhocki/version_gemfile" title="Version Gemfile source code">Github</a>. If you have any problems, open an issue there
or ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nhocki" title="My twitter profile">Twitter</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For about a year, I&#39;ve always had a question I ask someone I&#39;m interviewing for
a programming position. I&#39;ve asked this around 3 times and got some nice
answers, but I had never implemented it. The question is really simple:</p>

<p><strong>Given a linked list, how would you reverse it in <code>O(n)</code>?</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s my solution:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392454.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>Node = Struct.new(:id, :next)

# Build the list
first = Node.new(1, nil)
nodes = 10.times.map{|x| Node.new(x + 2, nil)}
nodes.each_with_index{|node, index| node.next = nodes[index + 1] }
first.next = nodes.first

def reverse_list(node)
  prox = node.next  # Get the next node on the list.
  node.next = nil   # Make the new tail point to nil (end of the new list).

  last = node       # Save that new tail on a tmp variable (to point to it later)
  node = prox       # Change the `current` node to the `next` one. Move ahead.

  while node          # If I'm not at the end of the list.
    prox = node.next  # Save the next node on the original list.
    node.next = last  # Reverse the list (point back from `current`)
    last = node       # Save the current node to point later.
    node = prox       # Move ahead once.
  end
  last
end

def print_list(node)
  while node
    puts node.id
    node = node.next
  end
end

print_list(first)
puts &quot;\n&quot;
print_list(reverse_list(first))
</code></pre></noscript></div>

<p>How would you do it? There&#39;s a really simple solution using a queue, but if you
find another one, I&#39;d love to hear about it on
<a href="https://twitter.com/nhocki">Twitter @nhocki</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am working on a new application that will use some <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/" title="Liquid Markup">Liquid</a> templates to
allow our clients to edit some templates.</p>

<p>We will store these templates in the Database, load them, parse them and render
them. So far, no magic.</p>

<p>But, I needed to have some &quot;partials&quot; for these. I wanted some common elements
(like image galleries) to be available for the client to use in that specific
template.</p>

<p>The way you normally accomplish this is by using an <code>include</code> tag, but I needed
a little bit more control. Not all the clients will have the same partials and
I also wanted the clients to be able to edit these partials.</p>

<p>So after reading the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/blob/master/lib/liquid/tags/include.rb#L49-61" title="Liquid include source code">Liquid source code</a>, I found a really easy way to do
this.</p>

<p>You just need an object that responds to <code>read_template_file</code> and it can take
1 or 2 arguments (please, go for 2). This method must return the Liquid <strong>source</strong>
of the partial (not a parsed template).</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s a really simple one that will work:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3645632.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code># Class to be used as a Liquid File System for the `include` tag
class LiquidTemplateSystem
  attr_reader :user

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  # Return a valid liquid template string
  def read_template_file(template_path, context)
    user.partials.find_by_name(template_path).liquid_source
  end
end


# In the view:
# This `template` has an {% include %} tag.
&lt;%= template.render(obj, registers: LiquidTemplateSystem.new(user)) %&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>

<h2 id="toc_71">Default FileSystem</h2>

<p>You could also set the default <code>FileSystem</code> with
<code>Liquid::Template.file_system = MyNewFileSystem.new</code>. This may be useful if you
want the partials to be shared on the database but not different for every user.</p>

<h2 id="toc_72">Any other way?</h2>

<p>Even though I find this to be <em>really</em> easy, another way may exist. If you know
of a better way to do this, please <a href="https://twitter.com/nhocki">let me know</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finished my first &quot;working season&quot; at <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a>. I got here
on October 4. It&#39;s been an amazing and weird journey.</p>

<p>But I have to admit that at first I was a bad employee. I was <strong>really</strong> used
to have somebody telling me what to do all the time. When I arrived at MIT that
didn&#39;t happen. <strong>At all</strong>. I was given some &quot;long term&quot; tasks and that was it.
I just had to do them.</p>

<p>Since no one was all over me checking my progress or asking me how I was
doing on everything, I was waisting a lot (*most*) of my time.
<a href="http://www.espndeportes.com">ESPNDeportes</a> got a lot of visits from me.
I started using Facebook on regular basis. <a href="http://www.threadless.com">Threadless</a>
didn&#39;t have enough T-shirts for me. <a href="http://twitter.com/nhocki">Twitter</a> was
not &quot;real time enough&quot;&#8230;</p>

<p>But, with time, I started working and I can&#39;t say how grateful I am for <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/management-style">this
way of managing</a>. I&#39;ve learned
to be much more productive on my own. To manage my time. To be much more
responsible. But, I guess the best thing about this was that I learned that
you just need to <strong>shut up, close all the meaningless things you have open and
get shit done</strong>.</p>

<p>Sure, if you need help, ask. If what you&#39;re doing is wrong, try again. But you
won&#39;t know something doesn&#39;t work if it&#39;s just an idea.</p>

<p>I became much more productive in everything. Not only MIT work stuff. Personal
(disposable) things I wanted to try.
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021810.do">Things</a> I wanted to learn.
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019664.do">Things I</a>
<a href="http://designinghypermediaapis.com/">wanted</a> <a href="http://objectsonrails.com/">to</a>
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/warv/the-rails-view">read</a> (even my
<a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> queue went down. By a lot!).</p>

<p>So, just try it out. It may take more than a week to get used to it, but just
try it. <strong>Close this post and every other distracting thing and do something</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while, this idea has been wondering around in my head.</p>

<p>I would love to have some web-development community in Medell칤n, but I would
like it to be &quot;something more&quot;. I love the idea of learning from others,
teaching and getting people involved. I know there are
<a href="http://coffeegrid.org/">more people</a> that are looking forward for this.</p>

<p>Sadly, we don&#39;t have a community like the one in Boston. It&#39;s amazing how
many events there are here. <a href="http://bostonrb.org/">Boston.rb</a> meets up to
3 times a month! It&#39;s just crazy! You just need to go to
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> to find an event of your interest! All
filled with people eager to share and help!</p>

<p>But I would love to put all that lovin&#39; to some &quot;charity&quot; work. Get real
projects for people that need it. <strong>It doesn&#39;t have to be 100% free</strong>,
but not charging nearly as much as you would normally do it!</p>

<p>For example, I know a <a href="http://www.bomberosenvigado.org/"><strong>Volunteer</strong> Fire Fighter Department</a>
that needs to build a simple learning system to distribute knowledge because
<strong>ignorance is taking a lot of lives</strong> (from firefighters and people they&#39;re
trying to save). Hell, they also need a new website!</p>

<p>I also know about a guy that needs a website for an organisation that helps
small kids with cancer in Africa.</p>

<p>All these projects could use the expertise of &quot;old&quot; developers and enthusiasm
from the ones that are just learning. I&#39;ve found that working on a real
project is way better than learning on your backyard. So why not take something
that could use more man-power and pair program on these websites?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we should not have presentations! Presentations should still
be the center of this. Sharing new stuff is the most important part for the
community. But maybe having some <em>hackathons</em> where we work on these projects.</p>

<p>So, what do you think? Would something like this work? Would people be
interested? Those organizations could, for example, sponsor the meetings
giving some beer and food! Developing companies could also sponsor this
and get some mention on the created websites. I know
<a href="http://www.zinergia.co">we</a> would do it!</p>

<p>I can&#39;t do it right now. I&#39;m 2.5K miles away! And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an
easy thing to organize, but I would like to know if people is actually
interested before I throw myself sending emails and talking to people,
so please contact me if you are, either by leaving a comment or
<a href="http://twitter.com/nhocki">pinging me on Twitter(@nhocki)</a>.</p>

<p>If you liked this idea, you might one to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4227721">up vote it in Hackernews</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/warv/the-rails-view">The Rails View</a> and the best chapter for me was about presenters. I&#39;ve been <a href="http://blog.nhocki.com/2012/01/31/thoughts-on-decorators-and-presenters/">working with this</a> for a while and I have to admit I love the approach presented on the view.</p>

<p>All the presenters I&#39;ve done were <a href="http://blog.nhocki.com/2012/01/10/simple-presenters--decorators-on-rails/">instantiated in the controller</a>. In the book they suggest that <strong>if the presenter doesn&#39;t depend on params or session variables it&#39;s the view responsibility to create it</strong>. This is extremely flexible specially when we&#39;re presenting various objects on the same view. Here&#39;s an example to present users in our application, let&#39;s use the same presenter for the <em>index</em> and <em>show</em> actions, but let&#39;s make it in a really simple way!</p>

<h3 id="toc_68">The Helper &amp; View</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s create the helper method first. It&#39;s really simple and will take a block that we can use to build a custom markup &quot;on the fly&quot;.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2640442.js?file=user_helpers.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># app/helpers/user_helpers.rb
def basic_information_for(user = @user, options = {})
  presenter = UserBasicPresenter.new(user, self, options)
  if block_given?
    yield(presenter)
  else
    presenter
  end
end</code></pre></noscript></div>

<p>Now, let&#39;s take a look at the views. In the <strong>show</strong> action, we&#39;re going to present only one user, and we can easily build the custom view for this. In the <strong>index</strong> action, we&#39;ll present all a &quot;basic info&quot; for the each user. We have that in a partial because this is used for all the collections of users in our application. Here&#39;s the view code:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2640442.js?file=user_views.html.erb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># app/views/show.html.erb
&lt;% basic_information_for do |user|  %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= user.name %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= user.status %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  ...
&lt;% end %&gt;

# app/views/index.html
&lt;% @users.each do |user| %&gt;
  &lt;%= basic_information_for(user) %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>

<h3 id="toc_69">The Presenter, A.K.A What&#39;s happening here?</h3>

<p>What makes this <strong>really</strong> clean is that we can actually use <code>&lt;%=  %&gt;</code> directly on our helper method. This works because we&#39;ll define the <code>to_s</code> method in our presenter! In this method we <strong>render our partial in the context of the helper</strong>, which is amazing. Here&#39;s the code for that:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2640442.js?file=user_basic_presenter.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># app/presenters/user_basic_presenter.rb
class UserBasicPresenter
  def initialize(user, template, options = {})
    @user     = user
    @options  = options

    @template.render partial: 'user/basic', object: self

<p>Is <strong>that</strong> simple! We have a unique interface (the helper) that will work great in both places! We could obviously make the presenter more complex, otherwise, why use it?</p>

<p>Even though I haven&#39;t used this approach a lot, I&#39;m really happy with it. I felt the difference instantly and it made a lot of sense to me. Being able to mix this with a <a href="http://blog.nhocki.com/2012/03/29/flexible-and-friendly-layouts-on-rails/">flexible layout</a> is really powerful!</p>

<h3 id="toc_70">Feedback</h3>

<p>I&#39;m also really interested in how people are using presenters. I&#39;d love to gain more feedbacks and points of view about this. Feel free to post a comment (here on in the gist) or ping me on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/nhocki">@nhocki</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#39;ve been working on a &quot;new&quot; project (I&#39;m new to the project, the project itself is &#39;old&#39;) and at the beginning I had to edit a bunch of stuff in the views.</p>

<p>A friend needed to change the header of the page on <strong>one</strong> action of the <code>UsersController</code>. He is new to rails and was struggling with this, so he asked me for help.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty common to have a <code>header</code> partial rendered on the view. If you&#39;re a lovely developer you would have <code>render &quot;header&quot;</code> and not something like <code>render &quot;layouts/header&quot;</code>. The reason behind this is simple. <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/269-template-inheritance" title="Railscasts Template Inheritance">Template Inheritance</a>. This means that if you&#39;re working on the <code>UsersController</code>, when rails looks for the <code>header</code> partial, it will first look for <code>users/header</code> moving up the parents chain, ending in <code>application/header</code>. So, next time, put all your <em>layout</em> stuff in <code>application/_partial</code> so you can easily override it!</p>

<p>But this is a <em>controller wide</em> solution, since all the actions from that controller will render the same partial. So, how do you achieve this on a single action? My solution is a 3 line helper:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2246251.js?file=application_helper.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># This method will allow a section to be rendered form a view or
# to render a partial instead.
# 
# It's really useful to have 'flexible' sections in the layout. E.g
# add this to your layout file:
#
# content_or_partial(:header)
#   =&gt; renders the content_for(:header) or the &quot;header&quot; partial
#
# content_or_partial(:header, 'users/hello')
#   =&gt; renders the content_for(:header) or the &quot;users/hello&quot; partial
#
# application.html.erb
#   &lt;header class=&quot;main-header wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;%= content_or_partial(:header) %&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
#
# users/show.html.erb
#   &lt;%= content_for :header do %&gt;
#     My action specific content
#   &lt;% end %&gt;
#
def content_or_partial(content, partial = content)
  content_for?(content) ? content_for(content) : render(partial.to_s)
end</code></pre></noscript></div>

<p>Now all you have to do is fill your layouts with &quot;content boxes&quot; that can be changed on an controller or action-specific need, giving great flexibility.</p>

<p>How would you get around this?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been developing a new app using a lot of <a href="http://blog.nhocki.com/2012/01/10/simple-presenters--decorators-on-rails/">decorators and presenters</a>. I&#39;ve been highly influenced by <a href="http://about.avdi.org/">Avdi</a> (both his <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/">blog</a> and his <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/11/15/early-access-beta-of-objects-on-rails-now-available-2/">Objects in Rails book</a>) and <a href="http://steveklabnik.com">Steve Klabnik</a>, but now I have a problem. My decorators are starting to get big. I&#39;ll have to use <code>concerns</code> for that. Expect another post about it (maybe).</p>

<p><strong>I want to warn you that I am not by any means an expert on the subject. So I&#39;m more than open to any feedback you can give me.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>All presenters are decorators, but not all decorators are presenters.</p>

<p>A decorator is a class that adds some sort of functionality to another
class. A presenter is a class that adds some sort of presentation
formatting functionality to another class.</p>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/objects-on-rails/htAopf3k_dM/qJMq6QAfMvsJ">Steve Klabnik</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that what a decorator <em>should</em> do is give a standard API for the processed data stored somewhere (probably a database). I don&#39;t think a decorator should be in charge of the markup of the presented data. For me, it makes no sense that the decorator (that is processed data for me), knows <em>how</em> it is being shown to the user.</p>

<p>That said, I think the <strong>same</strong> decorator should be used to build the JSON response and the HTML response. The HTML markup and JSON structure are <em>just</em> \&#39;markup\&#39;. So, they can be treated as templates.</p>

<h3 id="toc_65">So, where do the logic in the template goes?</h3>

<p>I had this discussion with a <a href="http://mheroin.com/">friend</a>, and he asked me that, with this approach, how would he add elements to a view depending on a condition, for example, the famous \&#39;***You are logged in as nhocki***\&#39; if there&#39;s a user logged in.</p>

<p>I think this should be created inside helper methods that takes a block. Inside that block you can use the <strong>decorator</strong> methods to show the needed data. You can use those methods in your JSON builder too (try out the new <a href="https://github.com/rails/jbuilder">Jbuilder</a>). You could bundle up these methods and re-use them in your projects too.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1714913.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code># app/models/user.rb
#
# User model has name &amp; username
#
# Only the username is required (signup with Github for example)
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :username, presence: true
end



# app/decorators/user_decorator.rb
#
# Let's use the Draper gem for the decorators
class UserDecorator &lt; ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :user

  def display_name
    user.name.presence || user.username
  end

  # Formatting the data is OK. I'm against adding the markup
  def salary
    h.number_to_currency(user.salary)
  end
end


# app/views/users/index.html.erb

# current_user is a presenter
&lt;%= logged_in_area do %&gt;
  You are logged in as &lt;%= current_user.display_name %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

# viewing @some_users's profile (which is also a presenter)
&lt;%= admin_area do %&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;salary&quot;&gt;&lt;%= @some_user.salary %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;


# app/helpers/application_helpers.rb
#
# We all hate helpers, but this time, they're useful.
def admin_area(&amp;block)
  content_tag(:div, capture(&amp;block), class: 'admin') if current_user.admin?
end</code></pre></noscript></div>

<h3 id="toc_66">Maybe I have the names wrong</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, I&#39;m no expert on design patterns. And I&#39;m pretty <em>new</em> to presenters and decorators. So, maybe my approach has a different name. I don&#39;t really care how this is called, I feel it&#39;s a more natural approach and it keeps the template and the processed data in different parts.</p>

<h3 id="toc_67">Please provide feedback</h3>

<p>It is also possible that I have it all wrong, that&#39;s why I&#39;m really interested in your opinion. I&#39;m eager to learn about everything from anyone, so I would love to have some feedback about this.
