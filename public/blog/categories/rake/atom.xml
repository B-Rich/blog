    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve been writing a lot of rake tasks lately. I like to have a lot of output (feedback) from my tasks, at least while I&#39;m writing them. I have colors in my tests, but my output is really ugly, so I took <a href="https://github.com/andmej/chatte/blob/master/client.rb#L15-24">some code</a> from <a href="https://github.com/andmej/chatte/">Chatte</a>, - a simple chat application a <a href="http://andr.esmejia.com/">friend</a> (and awesome <a href="https://github.com/andmej/">developer</a>, btw) wrote for college- and made some modifications for it. Here&#39;s my module right now…</p>

<p>{% gist 1410582 %}</p>

<p>Now, you just need to <code>include Colors</code> in your tasks and enjoy your life.</p>

<p>I know there&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/fazibear/colorize">colorize</a> gem out there, but I don&#39;t like their syntax. I prefer Andres&#39; approach much more, so maybe I&#39;ll turn this into a really simple gem. Do you think it&#39;s worth it?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, I&#39;ve been working on a side project with <a href="http://andr.esmejia.com/">Andrés
Mejía</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/andmej">@andmej</a>) and
for some really really sad reason <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> is not working
as expected (a simple git push should do the trick, but we&#39;re having a really
<a href="https://github.com/ddollar/rails_log_stdout/issues/4">weird issue</a>).</p>

<p>At first, I thought it had something to do with the assets. Even-though
<a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> has <a href="h%0Attp://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails31_heroku_cedar#the_asset_pipeline">asset compiling tasks on their Cedar stack</a>,
it didn&#39;t really worked for us at first. So I just decided to create a small
rake task to compile the assets and push them to Github.</p>

<p>The good thing about this rake task is that it will only push the assets. This
means, that <strong>you&#39;ll need a clean git tree to run this task or it will die</strong>.
This ensures that the automatic push <strong>won&#39;t commit any non-related change to
the compilation of the assets</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, you only have to run <strong>rake assets:compile</strong> and sleep well at night.
Here&#39;s the code. Hope it helps.</p>
