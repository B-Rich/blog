    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just wanted to "personally" say thanks to everyone who voted for my entry on
the <a href="http://rallyonrails.com">Rally on Rails</a> (Latinamerican Rails Rumble).</p>

<p><a href="http://timehub.net">Timehub</a> won! And this couldn't be possible without the
people who voted.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Rally on Rails team &amp; judges. They made an excellent
job and even though there are somethings to improve (like the voting rules),
<strong>I think that the contest was great!</strong></p>

<p>We had already posted a "<a href="http://blog.timehub.net/post/9404894926/from-medellin-with-love">thank you
note</a>", in
the <a href="http://timehub.net">Timehub</a> blog, but I really wanted to write one
myself.</p>

<p>I was pretty spammer during these last 3 days! That will stop now!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks again!</strong> Hope to see you in <a href="http://timehub.net">Timehub</a> v2!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://rallyonrails.com">Rally on Rails</a> contest took place this weekend,
we launched <a href="http://timehub.net">TimeHub</a>, a neat simple app to create
invoices from your Github commits.</p>

<p>The problem we're trying to solve here is simple. Most of us use Github, and
we add some commit messages to what we do. Then, we had to go to an invoice
app and write what we did (again!).</p>

<p><strong>Just so you know, we DO NOT access your code or anything related to it. We just need the commit messages. So you can sleep well at night knowing that your private repositories are safe.</strong></p>

<p>This was a waste of time and not fun at all! So we created TimeHub in about
30hours.</p>

<p>We created a <a href="http://blog.timehub.net/">blog</a> and posted a small insight on
how it works. <a href="http://blog.timehub.net/post/8973816486/launched">Read it
here</a>.</p>

<p>You should <a href="http://timehub.net">give it a try</a>! And if you like it, <strong><a href="http://rallyonrails.com/teams/47">please
vote for us</a></strong>!</p>

<p>To keep it simple, here's what you should do in your commit messages and let
<a href="http://timehub.net">TimeHub</a> handle the rest.</p>
