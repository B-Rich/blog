    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve been working on a &quot;new&quot; project (I&#39;m new to the project, the project itself is &#39;old&#39;) and at the beginning I had to edit a bunch of stuff in the views.</p>

<p>A friend needed to change the header of the page on <strong>one</strong> action of the <code>UsersController</code>. He is new to rails and was struggling with this, so he asked me for help.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty common to have a <code>header</code> partial rendered on the view. If you&#39;re a lovely developer you would have <code>render &quot;header&quot;</code> and not something like <code>render &quot;layouts/header&quot;</code>. The reason behind this is simple. <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/269-template-inheritance" title="Railscasts Template Inheritance">Template Inheritance</a>. This means that if you&#39;re working on the <code>UsersController</code>, when rails looks for the <code>header</code> partial, it will first look for <code>users/header</code> moving up the parents chain, ending in <code>application/header</code>. So, next time, put all your <em>layout</em> stuff in <code>application/_partial</code> so you can easily override it!</p>

<p>But this is a <em>controller wide</em> solution, since all the actions from that controller will render the same partial. So, how do you achieve this on a single action? My solution is a 3 line helper:</p>

<p>{% gist 2246251 application_helper.rb %}</p>

<p>Now all you have to do is fill your layouts with &quot;content boxes&quot; that can be changed on an controller or action-specific need, giving great flexibility.</p>

<p>How would you get around this?</p>
