  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been a <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-09-06-the-secret-to-rails-oo-design">lot</a> of <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-09-09-better-ruby-presenters">talk</a> <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/11/15/early-access-beta-of-objects-on-rails-now-available-2/">about</a><a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/14825364877/evaluating-alternative-decorator-implementations-in">decorators</a> and <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/13641910701/tidy-views-and-beyond-with-decorators">presenters</a> (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/objects-on-rails/htAopf3k_dM/qJMq6QAfMvsJ">which are almost the same</a>) in Rails and how they help you with a &#8220;real&#8221; OO code. There are great gems and there&#8217;s even a <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/287-presenters-from-scratch">Railscast</a> (pro) on how to build a presenter from scratch. But, in the new project I&#8217;m working on, we (&lt;- <a href="https://github.com/febuiles">he</a>) has this <strong>really</strong> simple setup which I feel kind of cleaner.</p>

<p>What we wanted to have was a <code>present</code> method in the controller and build the view from its methods. So, we created an <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html">ActiveSupport::Concern</a> called <code>Presentable</code> and included it in our application controller. Here&#8217;s our (once again, his) code for that module.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1592754.js?file=presentable.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># app/concerns/controllers/presentable.rb

# Presentable Concern
# Include this module in the controllers where
# you need the `present` method.
module Presentable
  # This method returns a Presenter Object to work
  # with in the view.
  #
  # Attributes:
  #   object:   The object to present
  #
  # Supported Options
  #    as:   The presenter class. If this is not suplied 
  #          the method will try to guess the class
  #          e.g: UserPresenter for a User object.
  def present(object, options = { })
    if object.respond_to?(:first)
      return [] if object.empty?
      presenter = &quot;#{object.first.class.to_s.pluralize}Presenter&quot;
    else
      presenter = &quot;#{object.class}Presenter&quot;
    end

    presenter = options.fetch(:as) { eval(presenter) }
    presenter.new(object)
  end
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Now, we just need to create each presenter. But, since there&#8217;s a lot of shared logic between presenters we (he) just created a parent <code>Presenter class</code> with all that. Notice that our presenter takes an object as parameter, so we just delegated all the method calls to our record (thank you <code>method missing</code>) if it responded to that method. You could also send the view context to access Rails helpers inside your presenter. Here&#8217;s our <code>Presenter base class</code>.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1592754.js?file=presenter.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># Base presenter class
# All presenters should inherit from this one.
class Presenter
  # Include all the modules you need or
  # send the view context to access rails helpers.
  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
  # ...

  include Presentable

  attr_reader :record

  def initialize(record)
    @record = record
    @klass = record.class
  end

  def method_missing(name, *arguments, &amp;block)
    super unless record.respond_to?(name)
    record.send(name, *arguments, &amp;block)
  end

  def translate_field_name(name)
    @klass.human_attribute_name(name)
  end

  # UrlHelper was being an ass, easier to go commando.
  def link_to(name, url, options={})
    href = { :href =&gt; url }
    content_tag(:a, name, options.merge(href))
  end
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Then, we just need to inherit from the <code>Presenter</code> class and add our custom, clean methods. Using <code>delegate and method missing</code> will help us keep the class clean. I won&#8217;t show you a presenter here, they&#8217;ll look a lot like Ryan&#8217;s one in his Railscasts so check that out first.</p>

<p>I will show you our controller though. Using the decent_exposure gem we managed to get super tiny controllers. Here&#8217;s 1 of them:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1592754.js?file=requests_controller.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>class RequestsController &lt; ApplicationController
  expose(:filter) { params.fetch(:filter) { :all} }
  expose(:filtered_requests) { Request.filter(filter) }
  expose(:requests) { present(filtered_requests) }

  before_filter :find_request, :only =&gt; [:show, :destroy]

  def index
  end

  def show
    extend(RequestRedirector) # Another concern
    redirect_to_request
  end

  def destroy
    @request.destroy
    redirect_to requests_path(:filter =&gt; &quot;new_requests&quot;), :notice =&gt; &quot;Se ha eliminado la solicitud&quot;
  end

  private
  def find_request
    @request = Request.find(params[:id])
  end
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Combining <code>presenters</code> and <code>form builders</code> will make your views even cleaner, giving a lot of pleasure to the future you! So please, just pretty-please, start using presenters and builders and leave helpers as simple as possible. Or, leave them for good.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be amazed how different you&#8217;ll feel when reading some old code or some co-worker&#8217;s code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been writing a lot of rake tasks lately. I like to have a lot of output (feedback) from my tasks, at least while I&#8217;m writing them. I have colors in my tests, but my output is really ugly, so I took <a href="https://github.com/andmej/chatte/blob/master/client.rb#L15-24">some code</a> from <a href="https://github.com/andmej/chatte/">Chatte</a>, - a simple chat application a <a href="http://andr.esmejia.com/">friend</a> (and awesome <a href="https://github.com/andmej/">developer</a>, btw) wrote for college- and made some modifications for it. Here&#8217;s my module right now…</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1410582.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>module Colors
  def colorize(text, color_code)
    &quot;\033[#{color_code}m#{text}\033[0m&quot;
  end

  {
    :black    =&gt; 30,
    :red      =&gt; 31,
    :green    =&gt; 32,
    :yellow   =&gt; 33,
    :blue     =&gt; 34,
    :magenta  =&gt; 35,
    :cyan     =&gt; 36,
    :white    =&gt; 37
  }.each do |key, color_code|
    define_method key do |text|
      colorize(text, color_code)
    end
  end
end

# green &quot;Hello&quot;
#   =&gt; &quot;\e[32mHello\e[0m&quot;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Now, you just need to <code>include Colors</code> in your tasks and enjoy your life.</p>

<p>I know there&#8217;s a <a href="https://github.com/fazibear/colorize">colorize</a> gem out there, but I don&#8217;t like their syntax. I prefer Andres&#8217; approach much more, so maybe I&#8217;ll turn this into a really simple gem. Do you think it&#8217;s worth it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, I&#8217;ve been working on a side project with <a href="http://andr.esmejia.com/">Andrés
Mejía</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/andmej">@andmej</a>) and
for some really really sad reason <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> is not working
as expected (a simple git push should do the trick, but we&#8217;re having a really
<a href="https://github.com/ddollar/rails_log_stdout/issues/4">weird issue</a>).</p>

<p>At first, I thought it had something to do with the assets. Even-though
<a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> has <a href="h%0Attp://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails31_heroku_cedar#the_asset_pipeline">asset compiling tasks on their Cedar stack</a>,
it didn&#8217;t really worked for us at first. So I just decided to create a small
rake task to compile the assets and push them to Github.</p>

<p>The good thing about this rake task is that it will only push the assets. This
means, that <strong>you&#8217;ll need a clean git tree to run this task or it will die</strong>.
This ensures that the automatic push <strong>won&#8217;t commit any non-related change to
the compilation of the assets</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, you only have to run <strong>rake assets:compile</strong> and sleep well at night.
Here&#8217;s the code. Hope it helps.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1241135.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>namespace :assets do
  desc &quot;Compile all the assets named in config.assets.precompile and push them&quot;
  task :compile do
    AssetsCompiler.new.compile
  end

  class AssetsCompiler
    def compile
      ensure_clean_git
      removed_previous_assets
      compile_assets
      commit_compiled_assets
      push
    end

    def ensure_clean_git
      raise &quot;Can't deploy without a clean git status.&quot; if git_dirty?
    end

    def removed_previous_assets
      run &quot;bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production assets:clean&quot;
    end

    def compile_assets
      run &quot;bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production assets:precompile&quot;
    end

    def commit_compiled_assets
      run &quot;git add -u &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -am 'Compiled assets'&quot;
    end

    def push
      run &quot;git push&quot;
    end

    private

    def run(command)
      puts &quot;+ Running: #{command}&quot;
      puts &quot;-- #{system command}&quot;
    end

    def git_dirty?
      `[[ $(git diff --shortstat 2&gt; /dev/null | tail -n1) != &quot;&quot; ]]`
      dirty = $?.success?
    end
  end
end</code></pre></noscript></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on a really cool project on my University. It&#8217;s a web application
to compare book editions and help professors build what is know as the
Collatzio. The Collatzio is simply the &#8220;original&#8221; version of the book. That
means, to have the book the author wanted to write and not the one that the
editors wanted to publish.</p>

<p>I needed to have two versions of the book aligned side by side. So, the
HTML/CSS was pretty simple. Just have two simple divs with <strong>overflow-y:
auto;</strong> to make the scrollbar appears on each div.</p>

<p>The coffeescript code I used is really simple, here it is:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1233545.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>jQuery ($) -&gt;
  ($ &quot;.scroll-text&quot;).scroll (event) -&gt;
    trigger = ($ @)
    element = trigger.data(&quot;scrolls&quot;)
    $(element).scrollTop(trigger.scrollTop())
    event.preventDefault()
    return false</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Hope it helps someone. I struggled a little bit with the &#8220;common&#8221; way of
scrolling things. People usually use the <code>animate</code> method to scroll the body,
but I couldn&#8217;t use it because it kept triggering the scroll event on the
elements, so it was an infinite loop.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;html, body&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">animate</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">scrollTop</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">},</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;slow&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>Yesterday, I was updating <a href="http://timehub.net">Timehub</a> to Rails 3.1, we had a rails3.1 branch and we were just waiting for the official version to change it.</p>

<p>As soon as I got home from the <a href="http://coffeegrid.org/">Coffee Grid</a> meetup (where we talked about Timehub), I decided to update it. What could possibly go wrong? We&#8217;ve been using a release candidate with <strong>no more than 3 days old</strong> and it was working just fine.</p>

<p>We changed our <code>Gemfile</code> and started to use Rails 3.1. We tested the app on development and everything was working as expected, so I just relaxed while deploying.</p>

<p>I <strong>always</strong> look at the server after a deploy, and to my surprise, <strong>no images where shown in the production environment</strong>. WTF? We were compiling our assets (with a small Capistrano task).</p>

<p>We watched the source of the page and instantly found the problem. The server was not looking for the images with the MD5 digest at the end. This was REALLY weird because we were using <code>image_tag</code> everywhere so we shouldn&#8217;t care about it!</p>

<p>This means that the server was looking for <code>/assets/rails.png</code> instead of
<code>/assets/rails-3289328982JAKSDJK.png</code></p>

<p>I looked to the awesome <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Asset Pipeline Guide</a>, I asked around with Twitter, I restarted the server several times. I did everything and nothing worked until <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/guilleiguaran">@guilleiguaran </a>gave me the answer on twitter!</p>

<p>You simply need to add those 2 lines to fix your assets (look up if you missed it!)</p>

<p>The problem is that it wasn&#8217;t really documented and that the release candidates didn&#8217;t have that! So it was <strong>REALLY</strong> hard to guess. Actually, I think @guilleiguaran knew because he made those changes!</p>

<p>After that, we could easily update and now we&#8217;re 100% on Rails 3.1!</p>

<p>Hope this helps you too!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may know, we created <strong><a href="http://timehub.net">Timehub</a></strong> in under 48
hours for the Rally on Rails contest. I wanted to write this post because it&#8217;s
been 48 hours since the <strong>public votes were opened</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>First of all, I would like to thank EVERYONE that has talked about Timehub. It&#8217;s been really nice to see all the comments and feedback. It&#8217;s been even better to see so many votes so fast! We honestly didn&#8217;t expected this support and having over 3950 points in under 48 hours! THANK YOU!</strong></p>

<p>it&#8217;s important to note that votes are still open (until August 26th), and if
you haven&#8217;t vote for us, you should! <a href="http://ranking.timehub.net/how-to-%0Avote">Click here to get the instructions and a
free heavenly holly ice-cream at the end</a> (spanish version <a href="http://ranking.timehub.net/como-votar">here</a>).</p>

<h2>The Judges</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s an honor to say that we won the judges votes. We got 88 points and got
the first place. Really really, scary-close was team 53 (moove it) with 86
points and in third place, it was team 43 (ochoigualiguald) with 82 points!</p>

<p>We were the only ones with 5/5 in innovation which really made us happy!</p>

<p><strong>I would like to thank the judges, sponsors and the Rally on Rails team to make this contest possible.</strong></p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at the public votes.</p>

<h2>How we started</h2>

<p>We started tweeting A LOT when we found out the votes were opened. <strong>Sorry for
all the spam my dear followers. It won&#8217;t last long. I promise. </strong>We really
needed the first impulse to make people notice us.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110824-rkkxubg89pdq5a9ctj1xm1i611.jpg" alt="My spam" /></p>

<p>We tweeted friends, coworkers, students, professors, some ruby-heroes, some
&#8220;public&#8221; tweets. Everything. We have a Skype conversation with what we tweeted
and prepared other tweets too. <strong>We&#8217;ve been thinking them for a while (is not
coincidence that our about page is actually a &#8220;showing our love&#8221; page (<a href="http://timehub.net/love">[http:
//timehub.net/love](http://timehub.net/love)</a>)</strong>.</p>

<h2>What we got</h2>

<p>We really did not expect what came next. A lot of people started talking about
<strong>Timehub</strong>. <strong>I had never felt like a rockstar before, but today was my day!
</strong>We got a lot of nice feedback. Ryan Bates from
<a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/rbates/status/106034170756739072">responded</a> (it was
AWESOME having him reply our tweet!). <a href="https://github.com/defunkt">Chris
Wanstrath</a> (defunkt - Githubs CEO) <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/defunkt/status/106061419325308928">retweeted
this</a>. Heck, we even
got a <a href="https://twitter.com/jcleblanc/status/105910807119933440">O&#8217;Reilly writer to tweet about
it</a>! The coolest
thing about that is that we really didn&#8217;t ask them to do that (we asked Ryan,
but the writer was just on his own will!) That was beautiful! Matthias Wiemann
tweeted and got 33 RTs!</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0M1Z0f1a1b0X1M3m1d2q/Screen%20Shot%202011-08-2%0A4%20at%201.49.28%20AM.png" alt="33 RTS!" /></p>

<p>We were on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> main page for a while.
In fact, that&#8217;s were we got the most feedback and visits from (more on that
later, with some graphs).</p>

<p>Of course, not everything was rainbows and butterflies. We also got some &#8220;bad&#8221;
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ifesdjeen/status/105970902675636224">comments</a> and
feedback (<strong>which we honestly really appreciate</strong>), but that was expected. We
admit, and have always admitted that the commit DLS needs to be MUCH better.
We&#8217;ll considering git notes and creating a gem to make it easier and keeping
commits as clean as possible. But we had 48  hours so for now, that&#8217;s the best
we could do.</p>

<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p>We were doing great (we still are btw) until some guys started cheating! I
thought, <strong>&#8220;OMG we&#8217;re doing SO GREAT that they have to cheat!&#8221;</strong> We created a
<a href="http://ranking.timehub.net/cheating">report</a> about it, and send it to the
judges. We decided to remove <a href="http://ranking.timehub.net/">our global ranking
page</a> while this was fixed. Judges fixed it right
away and we were back in the game!</p>

<p>This really made us sad. We worked really hard on the app and were working
(spamming) a lot to keep people talking about it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Data</h2>

<p>So, according to Google Analytics, we&#8217;ve got <strong>7,420 visits </strong>and<strong> 10,658
pageviews. </strong>This is amazing for 2 days. Honestly, didn&#8217;t expect it!</p>

<h2>Country/Territory of visits</h2>

<p>Probably what shocked me the most is that we&#8217;re now getting more visits from
the U.S than from Colombia. This is shocking because I expected my friends to
visit the site, but I don&#8217;t have more friends in the U.S than here! Here&#8217;s the
Top Five (out of <strong>104</strong> countries):</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1c3A0V1i1y1T0B3I1v22/Screen%20Shot%202011-08%0A-24%20at%202.18.13%20AM.png" alt="Top Five!" /></p>

<p>Honestly, 2000+ visits agains 800+? That&#8217;s a HUGE difference! Here&#8217;s the whole
map</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3a392z3f0r1I2W3j2i2K/Screen%20Shot%202011-08-24%20at%%0A202.20.59%20AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2>Traffic Sources</h2>

<p>The traffic sources also amazed me. We&#8217;ve had more referred visits than direct
traffic, but that was not really shocking (who&#8217;s gonna write timehub.net
anyway?)</p>

<p>What really shocked me is that even though we tweeted A LOT, got a lot of RTs
and a lot of people tweeted, it was half of the visits we got from Hacker
News!</p>

<p>With <strong>2,799 visits </strong>(more than direct traffic visits! - 2,424) Hacker News
was the #1 referrer and traffic source for us. Twitter (t.co + twitter.com)
was the second referrer but with <strong>851 visits (713 from t.co and 130 from
twitter.com)</strong>! That means that we got <strong>over 1900 visits from HN compared to
twitter</strong>! We were only a few minutes in the main page! I can&#8217;t imagine the
traffic a site will get for being there a whole morning! Here&#8217;s the top 10
(plus one) traffic sources:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3l1r101q022e330f370z/Screen%20Shot%202%0A011-08-24%20at%202.29.10%20AM.png" alt="Traffic Sources" /></p>

<p>I added the #11 to show that the traffic <strong>2,799 visits are only from the .com
domain. We&#8217;re getting traffic for .org/.net, ihackernews.com and others like
that!</strong></p>

<p><strong>I will be posting more and more details and info about how it goes. If you havent, please vote for us!</strong></p>

<p><strong>THANKS A LOT,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nicolás Hock Isaza</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://rallyonrails.com">Rally on Rails</a> contest took place this weekend,
we launched <a href="http://timehub.net">TimeHub</a>, a neat simple app to create
invoices from your Github commits.</p>

<p>The problem we&#8217;re trying to solve here is simple. Most of us use Github, and
we add some commit messages to what we do. Then, we had to go to an invoice
app and write what we did (again!).</p>

<p><strong>Just so you know, we DO NOT access your code or anything related to it. We just need the commit messages. So you can sleep well at night knowing that your private repositories are safe.</strong></p>

<p>This was a waste of time and not fun at all! So we created TimeHub in about
30hours.</p>

<p>We created a <a href="http://blog.timehub.net/">blog</a> and posted a small insight on
how it works. <a href="http://blog.timehub.net/post/8973816486/launched">Read it
here</a>.</p>

<p>You should <a href="http://timehub.net">give it a try</a>! And if you like it, <strong><a href="http://rallyonrails.com/teams/47">please
vote for us</a></strong>!</p>

<p>To keep it simple, here&#8217;s what you should do in your commit messages and let
<a href="http://timehub.net">TimeHub</a> handle the rest.</p>
