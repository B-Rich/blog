The [Rally on Rails](http://rallyonrails.com) contest took place this weekend,
we launched [TimeHub](http://timehub.net), a neat simple app to create
invoices from your GitHub commits.

The problem we're trying to solve here is simple. Most of us use Github, and
we add some commit messages to what we do. Then, we had to go to an invoice
app and write what we did (again!).

**Just so you know, we DO NOT access your code or anything related to it. We just need the commit messages. So you can sleep well at night knowing that your private repositories are safe.**

This was a waste of time and not fun at all! So we created TimeHub in about
30hours.

We created a [blog](http://blog.timehub.net/) and posted a small insight on
how it works. [Read it
here](http://blog.timehub.net/post/8973816486/launched).

You should [give it a try](http://timehub.net)! And if you like it, **[please
vote for us](http://rallyonrails.com/teams/47)**!

To keep it simple, here's what you should do in your commit messages and let
[TimeHub](http://timehub.net) handle the rest.
