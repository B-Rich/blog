I have finished my first "working season" at [MIT](http://mit.edu). I got here
on October 4. It's been an amazing and weird journey.

But I have to admit that at first I was a bad employee. I was **really** used
to have somebody telling me what to do all the time. When I arrived at MIT that
didn't happen. **At all**. I was given some "long term" tasks and that was it.
I just had to do them.

Since no one was all over me checking my progress or asking me how I was
doing on everything, I was waisting a lot (*most*) of my time.
[ESPNDeportes](http://www.espndeportes.com) got a lot of visits from me.
I started using Facebook on regular basis. [Threadless](http://www.threadless.com)
didn't have enough T-shirts for me. [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nhocki) was
not "real time enough"...

But, with time, I started working and I can't say how grateful I am for [this
way of managing](http://tomayko.com/writings/management-style). I've learned
to be much more productive on my own. To manage my time. To be much more
responsible. But, I guess the best thing about this was that I learned that
you just need to **shut up, close all the meaningless things you have open and
get shit done**.

Sure, if you need help, ask. If what you're doing is wrong, try again. But you
won't know something doesn't work if it's just an idea.

I became much more productive in everything. Not only MIT work stuff. Personal
(disposable) things I wanted to try.
[Things](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021810.do) I wanted to learn.
[Things I](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920019664.do)
[wanted](http://designinghypermediaapis.com/) [to](http://objectsonrails.com/)
[read](http://pragprog.com/book/warv/the-rails-view) (even my
[Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) queue went down. By a lot!).

So, just try it out. It may take more than a week to get used to it, but just
try it. **Close this post and every other distracting thing and do something**.
